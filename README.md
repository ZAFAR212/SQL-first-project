# SQL-first-project
This is my first project where I completed the restaurant case study from the 8 week SQL challenge from https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/. 
My aim is to learn how to pull and manipulate data from databases rather than  to create databases which is why I chose this project. 
The code in this file was my way of testing myself and learning new concepts. 
It took multiple approaches for me to solve questions which was my favourite aspect.
